```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readxl)
data<-read_xlsx("./covid_tbl_final.xlsx")
str(data)
```
```{r}
plot(data$Date, data$Deaths_total, main = "Total Deaths", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Deaths_total")
```
The graph shows there’s a break in between so the trend is discontinued for some days. So we plot daily deaths next to see what date has the breakage.
Plotting Daily dates by time.

```{r}
plot(data$Date, data$Deaths_daily, main = "Daily deaths", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Daily Deaths")

```
Identify outliers
Viewing the scatter plot we take the daily deaths greater than 75 as an outlier.
```{r}
outliers <- data[which(data$Deaths_daily > 75), ]
head(outliers[, c("SN","Date", "Deaths_daily")])
```
It shows that there are three records during february and march which has unusual no. of deaths. This data is correct as it was the correction over past counts. But this can’t be considered as a death of single date. Thus we need to distribute the death accordingly. We use daily % over total till that date to distribute the rate proportionally.
Performing percentage distribution in death rate we use daily % over total that date to distribute the rate proportionally.

```{r}
distribute_outlier <- function(SN_value) {
#SN_value = 399
  
  #Create adjustment to be made
  adjustment <- data[data$SN == SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily
  
  # Calculate average daily deaths based on last 60 days
  avg_deaths <- ceiling(mean(data[data$SN %in% c((SN_value - 1):(SN_value - 1 - 60)),]$Deaths_daily))
  
  # Assign average daily deaths 
  data[data$SN == SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily <- avg_deaths
  
  # Compute the total deaths till SN_Value
  total_deaths_399 <- sum(data[data$SN <= SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily)
  
  # Daily Death percent contribution till SN_Value
  daily_Death_percent <- data[data$SN <= SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily / total_deaths_399
  
  # Daily death distribution value
  daily_Death_distribution <- round(daily_Death_percent * (adjustment - avg_deaths))
  
  # Add the distribution value to all the days
  data[data$SN <= SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily = data[data$SN <= SN_value, ]$Deaths_daily + daily_Death_distribution
  
  # Get the remaining to be adjusted value
  additional_adjustment = (adjustment - avg_deaths) - sum(daily_Death_distribution)
  
  # Distribute each to the past few days
  additioal_distribution_range <- data$SN %in% c(SN_value: (SN_value -  additional_adjustment + 1))
  data[additioal_distribution_range, ]$Deaths_daily <- (data[additioal_distribution_range, ]$Deaths_daily + 1)
  return(data)
  }
```
Now plotting the train.

```{r}
data <- distribute_outlier(399)

  data$Deaths_daily,
  main = "Daily Deaths: 23 Jan 2020

  xlab = "Date",
  ylab = "Daily Deaths"
)
```
```{r}
data <- distribute_outlier(401)

# Plot the graph on new adjustment
plot(data$Date,
  data$Deaths_daily,
  main = "Daily Deaths: 23 Jan 2020

  xlab = "Date",
  ylab = "Daily Deaths"

Write a summary and recommendation for Ministry of Health, Nepal.

We fitted different models such as simple linear regression model, Quadratic model, Cubic model and so on till fifth order linear model including K Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural network for the given COVID data. The linear model fitted well with the training data when R Squared is compared but when RMSE is compared on the test data, KNN model has the lowest error.

Therefore a ministry of health can use KNN model to predict the death from COVID in future.
